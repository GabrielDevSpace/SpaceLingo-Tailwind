1
00:00:00,780 --> 00:00:03,000
what's up you guys it's Matt here so

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:05,520
today I'm mixing Brands here you know I

3
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:07,919
got Nike right here I got Adidas up here

4
00:00:07,919 --> 00:00:10,320
but really that does not matter what

5
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:12,000
does matter is the fact that we're

6
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,340
talking about xrp in the last video I

7
00:00:14,340 --> 00:00:15,780
made I appreciate all of the different

8
00:00:15,780 --> 00:00:17,880
views that we got and comments and stuff

9
00:00:17,880 --> 00:00:21,960
for uh that video understandably uh so I

10
00:00:21,960 --> 00:00:23,520
mean it's very very interesting to see

11
00:00:23,520 --> 00:00:24,480
that

12
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:27,119
we may potentially know when they're

13
00:00:27,119 --> 00:00:29,880
going to re-list xrp and also getting

14
00:00:29,880 --> 00:00:33,600
the information from the the uh CEO

15
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:36,300
himself saying that you know the reason

16
00:00:36,300 --> 00:00:38,820
why xrp was delisted it wasn't anything

17
00:00:38,820 --> 00:00:40,860
really behind

18
00:00:40,860 --> 00:00:42,360
um you know anything else where they

19
00:00:42,360 --> 00:00:43,920
were just like oh we delisted it because

20
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:45,899
of lack of volume or anything it's

21
00:00:45,899 --> 00:00:49,440
because of uh the fact that they wanted

22
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:52,020
to live by the rules

23
00:00:52,020 --> 00:00:54,360
and living by the rules means that you

24
00:00:54,360 --> 00:00:56,280
know the SEC says oh we're we're in a

25
00:00:56,280 --> 00:00:58,860
battle with them so we're gonna do this

26
00:00:58,860 --> 00:01:01,199
um but now that we're getting kind of

27
00:01:01,199 --> 00:01:02,579
close to the end and people are

28
00:01:02,579 --> 00:01:05,220
believing that xrp may end up winning

29
00:01:05,220 --> 00:01:08,040
this lawsuit and all of that

30
00:01:08,040 --> 00:01:10,260
um or at least coming out on top it

31
00:01:10,260 --> 00:01:11,880
doesn't mean it necessarily has to be a

32
00:01:11,880 --> 00:01:14,100
full win but anything that's really

33
00:01:14,100 --> 00:01:16,500
related positively into or that's

34
00:01:16,500 --> 00:01:20,040
positive towards xrp Cy I would say is

35
00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:21,840
definitely a win

36
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:24,840
um for them in the end

37
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:26,820
but I wanted to talk about xrp here

38
00:01:26,820 --> 00:01:28,560
today because some people don't believe

39
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:31,860
that the value is going to be as high as

40
00:01:31,860 --> 00:01:34,259
you know people say it's going to be now

41
00:01:34,259 --> 00:01:37,259
I know some of it can be absolutely it

42
00:01:37,259 --> 00:01:38,640
seemed like it could be far-fetched it

43
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:39,960
seemed like it could be you know

44
00:01:39,960 --> 00:01:42,000
completely out of this world

45
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,159
um and when it comes to a price but

46
00:01:44,159 --> 00:01:46,619
anything could happen now obviously I'm

47
00:01:46,619 --> 00:01:48,540
on the side where I'm like I'm more

48
00:01:48,540 --> 00:01:49,979
skeptical than anything that it could

49
00:01:49,979 --> 00:01:51,060
hit

50
00:01:51,060 --> 00:01:54,119
20 000 uh dollars per coin or a hundred

51
00:01:54,119 --> 00:01:55,920
thousand dollars per coin but I'm not

52
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:58,500
saying it's completely impossible I'm

53
00:01:58,500 --> 00:02:00,780
saying that it would be highly unlikely

54
00:02:00,780 --> 00:02:02,880
to have that happen I don't want to rule

55
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:05,280
anything out but I also don't want to

56
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:07,020
sit here and be like it's 100 gonna hit

57
00:02:07,020 --> 00:02:08,818
a hundred thousand dollars a year or

58
00:02:08,818 --> 00:02:10,560
sorry a hundred thousand dollars not a

59
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:11,940
hundred thousand dollars a year that

60
00:02:11,940 --> 00:02:13,379
would be crazy if it found a way to drop

61
00:02:13,379 --> 00:02:15,360
down and went up to 100 anyways it

62
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:17,040
doesn't matter but we're here to talk

63
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:18,900

patreon

78
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:46,379
um you know gets overlooked uh times we

79
00:02:46,379 --> 00:02:48,480
do have some one-on-ones we just posted

80
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:50,700
a one-on-one um with a patreon member

81
00:02:50,700 --> 00:02:52,319
and it was very beneficial to a lot of

82
00:02:52,319 --> 00:02:54,480
people not only him

83
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:57,180
but me and other people can get some

84
00:02:57,180 --> 00:03:00,599
strategies out of it as well now

85
00:03:00,599 --> 00:03:03,060
um like I said I talked about xrp in the

86
00:03:03,060 --> 00:03:05,459
video that I did today which obviously

87
00:03:05,459 --> 00:03:09,360
for you I I did it the day before right

88
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:10,440
so

89
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:13,140
um we look at this video a re-listed xrp

90
00:03:13,140 --> 00:03:15,959
for coinbase and this video got about 20

91
00:03:15,959 --> 00:03:17,400
000 views the most views that I've

92
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:19,200
gotten in a while like I've had some

93
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:22,620
that had 10 that had that had had a 15

94
00:03:22,620 --> 00:03:25,140
um but never or not in the level of 20

95
00:03:25,140 --> 00:03:27,300
or above so this is fantastic to be able

96
00:03:27,300 --> 00:03:28,560
to see that

97
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:30,360
and how many views it is getting so

98
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:32,340
thank you guys uh everybody that has

99
00:03:32,340 --> 00:03:34,739
watched this video I appreciate it so

100
00:03:34,739 --> 00:03:35,879
much

101
00:03:35,879 --> 00:03:37,860
um but there was also some interesting

102
00:03:37,860 --> 00:03:40,500
things uh that came with it where uh

103
00:03:40,500 --> 00:03:42,659
people were just wondering like if I

104
00:03:42,659 --> 00:03:43,980
truly believe that this is going to get

105
00:03:43,980 --> 00:03:45,840
to a crazy price like not only worrying

106
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:48,239
about you know confirming where it's uh

107
00:03:48,239 --> 00:03:50,040
you know confirming uh when it's getting

108
00:03:50,040 --> 00:03:54,180
relisted or why it was uh delisted but

109
00:03:54,180 --> 00:03:56,280
also just trying to get an understanding

110
00:03:56,280 --> 00:03:57,420
of

111
00:03:57,420 --> 00:03:59,879
whether it's going to get to a five

112
00:03:59,879 --> 00:04:01,980
dollar ten dollar twenty dollar a

113
00:04:01,980 --> 00:04:03,599
hundred dollar one hundred thousand

114
00:04:03,599 --> 00:04:07,080
dollar price and honestly as you go up

115
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:09,299
the scale you you start to look at a

116
00:04:09,299 --> 00:04:11,459
less likely

117
00:04:11,459 --> 00:04:13,319
um less likelihood for it to get to

118
00:04:13,319 --> 00:04:15,420
those uh levels

119
00:04:15,420 --> 00:04:17,699
um you know the probability starts to uh

120
00:04:17,699 --> 00:04:20,339
dwindle a little bit so uh I'm gonna get

121
00:04:20,339 --> 00:04:22,019
into that let's go ahead and dive into

122
00:04:22,019 --> 00:04:24,780
where xrp is right now so if we go over

123
00:04:24,780 --> 00:04:26,340
to the chart

124
00:04:26,340 --> 00:04:29,759
xrp is currently at about 51 and a half

125
00:04:29,759 --> 00:04:32,759
or 52 cents it's really been around this

126
00:04:32,759 --> 00:04:35,100
point for the whole entire time as you

127
00:04:35,100 --> 00:04:36,060
know

128
00:04:36,060 --> 00:04:38,340
um xrp was you know is in this or

129
00:04:38,340 --> 00:04:40,259
ripples in this battle

130
00:04:40,259 --> 00:04:42,780
um with the SEC to really uh kind of say

131
00:04:42,780 --> 00:04:44,940
that they're not you know an

132
00:04:44,940 --> 00:04:47,160
unregistered security

133
00:04:47,160 --> 00:04:47,880
um

134
00:04:47,880 --> 00:04:50,160
that they're not doing things illegally

135
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:51,419
here right

136
00:04:51,419 --> 00:04:53,340
um that you're seeing and you saw a

137
00:04:53,340 --> 00:04:55,740
price drop right you saw the price pull

138
00:04:55,740 --> 00:04:56,759
back

139
00:04:56,759 --> 00:04:59,460
um but not only pull back from that it

140
00:04:59,460 --> 00:05:01,560
most likely pulled back from the overall

141
00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:03,300
markets and how they were functioning

142
00:05:03,300 --> 00:05:05,639
rather than you know just the lawsuit

143
00:05:05,639 --> 00:05:08,340
because right now you're seeing a lot of

144
00:05:08,340 --> 00:05:10,620
other cryptocurrencies getting hit and

145
00:05:10,620 --> 00:05:12,180
being named

146
00:05:12,180 --> 00:05:15,419
um as you know potential Securities and

147
00:05:15,419 --> 00:05:16,620
some of those are really getting hit

148
00:05:16,620 --> 00:05:19,500
hard like Adam or Solana or algoran

149
00:05:19,500 --> 00:05:22,320
right getting hit very very hard

150
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:24,000
um and basically saying that everything

151
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:27,960
out there is a security besides Bitcoin

152
00:05:27,960 --> 00:05:30,000
and that's what the SEC is saying so

153
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,560
you're seeing all of those kind of fall

154
00:05:31,560 --> 00:05:33,419
back but xrp is sort of remaining the

155
00:05:33,419 --> 00:05:35,880
same so xrp is showing that it has a ton

156
00:05:35,880 --> 00:05:38,280
of strength seeing that at about 51 and

157
00:05:38,280 --> 00:05:40,560
a half cents 52 cents

158
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:42,539
um showing a 27 billion dollar market

159
00:05:42,539 --> 00:05:43,740
cap

160
00:05:43,740 --> 00:05:45,900
um and this is what's phenomenal right

161
00:05:45,900 --> 00:05:47,639
because we know that this can get back

162
00:05:47,639 --> 00:05:49,440
up to a dollar right A dollar is not

163
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:50,639
really the level where people are like

164
00:05:50,639 --> 00:05:52,199
all right well this is this is just

165
00:05:52,199 --> 00:05:53,400
gonna get to a dollar and we're gonna

166
00:05:53,400 --> 00:05:55,560
accept it there we know that it can go a

167
00:05:55,560 --> 00:05:57,180
lot further than that

168
00:05:57,180 --> 00:05:59,820
we know that xrp should be worth you

169
00:05:59,820 --> 00:06:01,380
know tens of billion should be worth

170
00:06:01,380 --> 00:06:04,080
hundreds of billions honestly and some

171
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:06,060
people believe that it should be worth

172
00:06:06,060 --> 00:06:08,699
trillions or tens of trillions and some

173
00:06:08,699 --> 00:06:10,919
people even hundreds of trillions now

174
00:06:10,919 --> 00:06:14,280
I'm not really in where they are right

175
00:06:14,280 --> 00:06:16,500
now I couldn't say that because the

176
00:06:16,500 --> 00:06:18,120
markets they aren't even worth that much

177
00:06:18,120 --> 00:06:20,400
and I always compare everything to the

178
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:22,259
uh thing that's leading the market which

179
00:06:22,259 --> 00:06:23,580
is Bitcoin

180
00:06:23,580 --> 00:06:25,620
and Bitcoin kind of will forever have

181
00:06:25,620 --> 00:06:27,539
that that effect to where it's it's

182
00:06:27,539 --> 00:06:30,360
definitely gonna be in the top five if

183
00:06:30,360 --> 00:06:32,039
not stay at one the whole entire time

184
00:06:32,039 --> 00:06:33,840
right I'm a big fan of ethereum and I

185
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:35,880
think ethereum can take over but with

186
00:06:35,880 --> 00:06:39,000
how much people put into like what

187
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,100
Bitcoin is even though it's not the best

188
00:06:41,100 --> 00:06:43,199
cryptocurrency out there right it's kind

189
00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:45,360
of like um I don't know LeBron shoes

190
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:47,819
right you know that Michael Jordan shoes

191
00:06:47,819 --> 00:06:50,039
are are fantastic but LeBron shoes still

192
00:06:50,039 --> 00:06:53,400
cost like 250 dollars or you know 200 or

193
00:06:53,400 --> 00:06:55,080
whatever right they cost the same amount

194
00:06:55,080 --> 00:06:57,660
as what you would have with you know um

195
00:06:57,660 --> 00:07:00,300
not not every single Jordan you know not

196
00:07:00,300 --> 00:07:02,280
Jordan Ones or whatever right depending

197
00:07:02,280 --> 00:07:04,259
on which ones they are Chicago's or

198
00:07:04,259 --> 00:07:05,340
something

199
00:07:05,340 --> 00:07:07,979
um it but what you're seeing is kind of

200
00:07:07,979 --> 00:07:09,900
that comparison

201
00:07:09,900 --> 00:07:13,020
um basically saying that this is this is

202
00:07:13,020 --> 00:07:15,060
out here it's it's going to be up there

203
00:07:15,060 --> 00:07:18,300
in the in the conversation but it has no

204
00:07:18,300 --> 00:07:20,280
real reason to be up there not saying

205
00:07:20,280 --> 00:07:21,720
that LeBron doesn't have a reason to be

206
00:07:21,720 --> 00:07:23,520
up there but let's leave it away for

207
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:25,440
from a Sports Talk even though I brought

208
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:27,660
it there

209
00:07:27,660 --> 00:07:29,340
um but yeah that's the way that I I see

210
00:07:29,340 --> 00:07:31,680
it there so I know that there's a lot of

211
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:34,199
predictions for xrp to go up to three

212
00:07:34,199 --> 00:07:35,699
dollars four dollars five dollars ten

213
00:07:35,699 --> 00:07:37,199
dollars and I see those and I see those

214
00:07:37,199 --> 00:07:39,000
as possibilities

215
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,919
um and some people there's a lot of

216
00:07:40,919 --> 00:07:42,360
people actually that don't believe that

217
00:07:42,360 --> 00:07:43,860
this is going to be the case at all that

218
00:07:43,860 --> 00:07:45,900
xrp is just gonna dwindle down it's

219
00:07:45,900 --> 00:07:47,400
going to decrease and nobody's gonna be

220
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:50,460
a fan of it anymore which is something I

221
00:07:50,460 --> 00:07:51,479
don't believe I think it's going to be

222
00:07:51,479 --> 00:07:53,580
worth way more than those people think

223
00:07:53,580 --> 00:07:56,940
uh for the normal xrp holder the the

224
00:07:56,940 --> 00:07:59,520
person that really loves this position

225
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:01,440
yeah of course you're going to have the

226
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:03,960
highest expectations possible

227
00:08:03,960 --> 00:08:06,599
um but even your expectations sometimes

228
00:08:06,599 --> 00:08:08,460
when you see it because you have your

229
00:08:08,460 --> 00:08:10,380
expectations you have

230
00:08:10,380 --> 00:08:13,080
um what reality is and then you have the

231
00:08:13,080 --> 00:08:14,639
maximum amount that you can gain now the

232
00:08:14,639 --> 00:08:16,620
maximum amount is you you probably look

233
00:08:16,620 --> 00:08:18,180
at it and go well it has low probability

234
00:08:18,180 --> 00:08:19,919
your expectation is probably a little

235
00:08:19,919 --> 00:08:21,120
bit lower

236
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:22,560
um so I would say that a lot of your

237
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:24,960
expectations are going to be uh reached

238
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:25,979
if not

239
00:08:25,979 --> 00:08:28,919
um exceeded the extra expectation so

240
00:08:28,919 --> 00:08:29,460
um

241
00:08:29,460 --> 00:08:31,680
xrp again if you guys want to look up

242
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:32,880
some predictions there's a lot of

243
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:34,200
predictions out there and look up the

244
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:36,539
reasons as to why you can see a hundred

245
00:08:36,539 --> 00:08:38,640
thousand dollars per coin

246
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:40,200
um you know it makes me laugh because

247
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:43,080
it's it's definitely worth a hell of a

248
00:08:43,080 --> 00:08:45,899
lot market cap wise but I can't say it's

249
00:08:45,899 --> 00:08:48,120
absolutely impossible not gonna say that

250
00:08:48,120 --> 00:08:50,220
